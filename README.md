# SchwingerModel

This is still far from being completed ...

To do:

- [x] Implement matrix operations
  - [ ] I still have to check if the way I vectorize the coordinates is convenient, considering the fact that mu = 0 refers to time and mu = 1 to space
- [x] Implement conjugate gradient
- [ ] Compute the force and the action
- [ ] Finish HMC implementation
- [ ] Compare results with python code (measure average plaquette value)
- [ ] See if it is worth improving the performance. After this step, I'll proceed with the multigrid.
